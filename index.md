# UsabilityHub

The idea of the UsabILItyHub is to receive meta data like ili2db settings, layer styles and orders etc. automatically over the web. 

Like we can now receive models by connecting the ilimodels.xml of [http://models.interlis.ch](http://models.interlis.ch/) and with it's ilisite.xml many other repositories, we will be able to get this meta data with the file ilidata.xml on the UsabILItyHub
